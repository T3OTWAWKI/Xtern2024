I am currently inexperienced with actual coding of AI, but my thoughts are below.

Outline your process for model selection, training and testing. Including data preparation.

    Currently, there are around 4000 data points given to us. I would have the code look at the data and use the percentages I discussed in my data analysis to determine the most likely orders
    For training, I would first feed the model a chunk of the data points as a basis and start feeding it the others to see how it does. I will also use this as testing
